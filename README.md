AIAnalysis App is a Java-based application designed to recognize AI-generated content and determine whether a given text is written by AI or a human. It also includes a text humanization feature that rewrites AI-generated content into simple, natural, and human-like language.

To run the project, open it in IntelliJ IDEA and execute the main Java file. If the project throws errors related to missing libraries, it requires an external JSON JAR file. You can obtain this JAR by asking ChatGPT to provide a download link for the JSON JAR file, opening the link in a browser, and downloading it.

After downloading, go to IntelliJ IDEA → Project Structure → Libraries, add the JAR file, and apply the changes. Once configured, the project will run smoothly and provide accurate AI detection and text humanization features.
